# mapping-codebases

Generate navigable code maps for unfamiliar codebases. Extracts exports/imports via AST (tree-sitter) to create _MAP.md files per directory showing classes, functions, methods with signatures and line numbers. Use when exploring repositories, understanding project structure, analyzing unfamiliar code, or before modifications. Triggers on "map this codebase", "explore repo", "understand structure", "what does this project contain", or when starting work on an unfamiliar repository.
