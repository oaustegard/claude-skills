# mapping-codebases

Generate navigable code maps for unfamiliar codebases. Use when exploring a new codebase, needing to understand project structure, or before diving into code modifications. Extracts exports/imports via AST (tree-sitter) to create _MAP.md files per directory. Triggers on "map this codebase", "understand this project structure", "generate code map", or when starting work on an unfamiliar repository.
