# developing-preact

Preact development for dynamic web applications requiring reactive state management, complex interactions, or real-time updates. Use only when vanilla HTML/CSS/JS cannot efficiently handle the requirements. Specializes in zero-build solutions with HTM syntax, data visualization, SPAs, WebGL integration, and native-first architecture with minimal dependencies.
