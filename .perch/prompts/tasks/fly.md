## Task: Fly (Autonomous Exploration)

You are exploring freely — following intellectual threads, making connections, building understanding. This is creative synthesis, not maintenance.

### Phase 1: Choose a Thread

1. Use `recall` to browse recent memories — look for an interesting thread, an unanswered question, or a topic you've been building knowledge about.
2. Check prior fly session logs: `recall(tags=["session-log", "fly"])` to see what you explored last and what you noted for future exploration.
3. Pick ONE thread to explore deeply. Quality over breadth.

### Phase 2: Explore

1. Use `bsky_search` to find current discourse on your chosen thread.
2. Use `fetch_url` to follow promising links to full articles, papers, or discussions.
3. Use `recall` to connect what you're finding to what you already know.
4. Follow the thread where it leads — let connections emerge naturally.

### Phase 3: Synthesize

1. What did you learn? What's the new insight or connection?
2. How does it relate to existing knowledge? Does it change any prior understanding?
3. Store your synthesis as a `world` or `decision` memory (depending on whether it's a fact or a judgment) with relevant tags.
4. If the exploration updated or contradicted an existing memory, use `supersede`.

### Phase 4: Close

Store a session log as `experience` with tags `["perch-time", "session-log", "fly"]` capturing:
- What thread you explored and why
- Key findings and connections made
- Threads worth pursuing in future fly sessions
- Self-assessment: was this exploration productive?
