# Creative and Generative Tasks

**Opus**: Produces varied, stylistically rich output. Maintains
persona/voice consistently across long outputs.

**Haiku**: Creative output is functional but less distinctive. Voice
consistency degrades in longer outputs. Falls back to generic phrasing.

**Mitigation**: Provide a style exemplar AND explicit style rules.

```
Voice: Match the style of this example:
"[2-3 sentence exemplar in target voice]"

Rules:
- Use active voice
- Vary sentence length between 5 and 25 words
- No cliches from this list: [enumerate]
- Paragraph length: 3-5 sentences
```

For Haiku, a concrete exemplar paragraph is worth more than ten
adjectives describing the desired tone.
