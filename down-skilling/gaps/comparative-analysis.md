# Comparative Analysis

**Opus**: Naturally structures comparisons. Weighs trade-offs. Arrives
at nuanced conclusions that acknowledge context-dependency.

**Haiku**: Comparisons tend toward surface-level listing of differences.
May not weigh factors or synthesize into a recommendation. Can produce
unbalanced comparisons (more detail on first item than last).

**Mitigation**: Provide the comparison framework explicitly.

```
Compare using EXACTLY these dimensions:
1. Cost (provide specific numbers if available)
2. Performance (cite metrics from the data)
3. Ease of use (based on stated requirements)

For each dimension:
- State Option A's position in one sentence
- State Option B's position in one sentence
- Declare a winner for that dimension: A, B, or TIE

After all dimensions, provide:
Overall recommendation: A or B
Reasoning: one sentence citing the decisive factor.
```

For balanced treatment:
- Use a table format (enforces equal space per option)
- Specify equal word counts per option
- Process options in consistent order across dimensions
