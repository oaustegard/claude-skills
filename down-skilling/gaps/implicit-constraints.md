# Implicit Constraints

**Opus**: Infers unstated constraints from context. Knows a business
email should be professional without being told.

**Haiku**: Follows explicit constraints well. May violate implicit ones.
Tone, formality, and audience-appropriateness can drift.

**Mitigation**: Make every constraint explicit. Enumerate what Opus
would assume.

```
Tone: professional and concise.
Audience: C-suite executives.
Avoid: jargon, hedging language, bullet points.
Include: specific metrics where available.
```

Ask yourself: what would a thoughtful person assume about this task
that isn't written down? Write those assumptions as rules.
