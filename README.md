# claude-skills
My collection of Claude skills -- primarily used for the CLaude.ai PaaS skill compute environment, mileage will vary if attempted used as Claude Code Agent Skills 

## Installing Skills

1. To install a skill in Claude.ai you first need a paid account (Claude Pro or Team)
2. Download the skill ZIP from the [Releases page](../../releases)
   - **Note:** Each release includes a direct download link for the skill ZIP - use that, not the "Source code" archives auto-generated by GitHub
3. Upload to [Claude.ai Skills Settings](https://claude.ai/settings/capabilities)
4. See [official documentation](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512198-how-to-create-custom-skills) for more details

## Contributing Skills

(Not actually sure the workflow for a forked repo back to mine -- someone will have to test and report...)

### Via ZIP Upload (Easiest)

1. Create your skill folder with `SKILL.md` at the root
2. Package your skill:
   ```bash
   # Correct structure:
   your-skill.zip
     └── your-skill/
         ├── SKILL.md
         └── resources/  (optional)
   ```
3. Upload the ZIP to the `uploads/` directory
4. The workflow will automatically create a PR with your skill

### Via Direct Development

1. Create a new branch
2. Add your skill folder at the repository root
3. Include a `VERSION` file (e.g., `1.0.0`)
4. Submit a PR

## Releasing Skills

Skills are automatically released when VERSION files are updated on the main branch.

### Creating a New Release

1. Update the `VERSION` file in your skill folder:
   ```bash
   echo "1.1.0" > your-skill/VERSION
   ```

2. Commit and push (or merge PR):
   ```bash
   git add your-skill/VERSION
   git commit -m "chore: bump your-skill to v1.1.0"
   git push
   ```

3. The workflow will automatically:
   - Create a properly structured ZIP file
   - Generate a GitHub release with tag `your-skill-v1.1.0`
   - Attach the ZIP as a release asset
   - Generate release notes from recent commits

### Manual Release

You can also trigger a release manually via GitHub Actions:

1. Go to Actions → Release Skill → Run workflow
2. Enter the skill folder name
3. Optionally specify a version (otherwise uses VERSION file)

### Version Format

Use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/):
- `1.0.0` - Initial release
- `1.0.1` - Patch (bug fixes)
- `1.1.0` - Minor (new features, backward compatible)
- `2.0.0` - Major (breaking changes)
