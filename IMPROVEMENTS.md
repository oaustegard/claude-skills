# Skills Improvement Log

**Generated:** 2025-11-09
**Branch:** claude/log-skill-improvements-011CUy5nyNw8YGjkGWmYvTg4
**Skills Analyzed:** 16

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-18

## ⚠️ UPDATE: README.md Clarification

**README.md files are NOT anti-patterns in this repository.** They are auto-generated from SKILL.md frontmatter and automatically removed during the release process. They do not appear in final skill bundles. References to README.md as an anti-pattern in this document are **no longer valid**.

AGENTS.md has been updated to reflect this clarification.

## Implementation Status (as of 2025-11-18)

### ✅ Phase 1 Complete
- ✅ creating-skill reduced from 511→410 lines
- ✅ preact-developer duplicate deleted entirely
- ✅ All skills now under 500-line limit

### ✅ Phase 2 Partial
- ✅ check-tools description condensed
- ✅ check-tools reduced from 473→431 lines
- ⏳ convening-experts examples/ consolidation (pending)
- ⏳ developing-preact description review (pending)

### Token Savings Achieved
- **~440 tokens saved** from Phase 1 completions

---

## Executive Summary

Analysis of all 16 skills reveals 3 critical issues, 3 high-priority improvements, and multiple optimization opportunities. Total potential token savings: **~480 tokens per session**.

### Critical Issues (RESOLVED)
- ✅ **1 skill exceeds 500-line limit** (creating-skill: 511 lines) - NOW 410 lines
- ✅ **1 duplicate skill pair** (developing-preact / preact-developer: 95%+ identical) - DELETED
- ~~**1 anti-pattern violation** (preact-developer has README.md)~~ - NOT AN ANTI-PATTERN (see update above)

### Key Findings
- ~~3 skills exceed or approach 500-line limit~~ - ALL NOW COMPLIANT
- ~~2 skills have redundant/duplicate content~~ - RESOLVED
- 1 skill has non-standard directory structure (convening-experts examples/)
- Multiple skills have verbose frontmatter descriptions

---

## Priority Actions

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Must Fix)

#### 1. creating-skill (511 lines) - EXCEEDS LIMIT
**File:** `/home/user/claude-skills/creating-skill/SKILL.md`
**Current:** 511 lines (exceeds 500-line limit by 11 lines)
**Target:** <450 lines

**Issues:**
- Lines 145-200: Embedded environment documentation duplicates references/environment-reference.md
- Lines 250-317: Large MCP tools section should be in references/
- Lines 68-80: Verbose `create_file` vs `str_replace` guidance could move to references/

**Action Plan:**
1. Delete embedded environment docs (lines 145-200) - they're already in references/
2. Move MCP tools details (lines 250-317) to references/mcp-tools.md
3. Condense create_file guidance (lines 68-80) to 2-3 lines with reference pointer
4. Verify reduction achieves <450 lines

**Expected Impact:** -60 tokens, compliance with repository standards

---

#### 2. preact-developer - DUPLICATE & ANTI-PATTERN
**File:** `/home/user/claude-skills/preact-developer/`
**Status:** 95%+ identical to developing-preact

**Issues:**
- Contains README.md (violates AGENTS.md guidelines: "No README.md or CHANGELOG.md")
- Near-complete duplication with developing-preact
  - Identical decision framework (lines 1-71)
  - Identical technical standards
  - Identical examples
- Wastes ~380 tokens in context

**Action Plan (Choose One):**

**Option A (Recommended):** Consolidate into developing-preact
1. Keep developing-preact (better gerund naming)
2. Delete preact-developer/ entirely
3. Verify no unique content lost

**Option B:** Clearly differentiate
1. If functional difference exists, document in both frontmatter descriptions
2. Remove all duplicate content
3. Delete README.md from preact-developer
4. Clarify when to use each

**Expected Impact:** -380 tokens, eliminates confusion, removes anti-pattern

---

#### 3. preact-developer/README.md - ANTI-PATTERN
**File:** `/home/user/claude-skills/preact-developer/README.md`
**Issue:** Violates AGENTS.md line 491: "No README.md or CHANGELOG.md (not needed for skills)"

**Action Plan:**
1. Delete README.md immediately
2. If content is valuable, move to references/migration-notes.md

**Expected Impact:** Compliance with repository standards

---

### 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY (Improve Quality)

#### 4. check-tools - Verbose Description
**File:** `/home/user/claude-skills/check-tools/SKILL.md`
**Current:** 473 lines (near limit), 260+ char description
**Target:** <450 lines, ~120 char description

**Issues:**
- Lines 6-14: "Purpose" section repeats frontmatter description
- Frontmatter description is overly verbose (260+ chars)

**Action Plan:**
1. Condense description from:
   ```
   Validates development tool installations across Python, Node.js, Java, Go, Rust, C/C++, Git, and system utilities. Use when verifying environments, troubleshooting missing dependencies, or documenting system requirements. Generates comprehensive reports showing installed versions, missing tools, and installation recommendations. Supports both automated checking and guided manual verification workflows.
   ```
   To (~120 chars):
   ```
   Validates development tool installations across Python, Node.js, Java, Go, Rust, C/C++, Git, and system utilities. Use when verifying environments or troubleshooting dependencies.
   ```

2. Delete redundant "Purpose" section (lines 6-14)

**Expected Impact:** -20 tokens, better clarity

---

#### 5. convening-experts - Non-Standard Structure
**File:** `/home/user/claude-skills/convening-experts/`
**Issue:** Has `examples/` directory (non-standard pattern)

**Current Structure:**
```
convening-experts/
├── SKILL.md
├── examples/
│   └── [multiple files]
└── references/
```

**Standard Pattern:**
```
convening-experts/
├── SKILL.md
└── references/
    └── examples.md
```

**Action Plan:**
1. Consolidate examples/* files into references/examples.md
2. Delete examples/ directory
3. Update SKILL.md references from examples/* to references/examples.md

**Expected Impact:** Structural consistency, better progressive disclosure

---

#### 6. developing-preact - Resolve Duplicate
**File:** `/home/user/claude-skills/developing-preact/SKILL.md`
**Current:** 453 lines, 185-char description
**Related:** See item #2 (preact-developer)

**Issues:**
- 95%+ overlap with preact-developer
- Description could be more concise (185 chars → 100-120 chars)

**Action Plan:**
1. After resolving preact-developer duplicate (item #2), condense description
2. Review if decision framework (lines 18-70) could move to references/

**Expected Impact:** -40 tokens (after consolidation)

---

### 🟢 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Optimization)

#### 7. Verbose Frontmatter Descriptions

**Target:** All descriptions should be 60-120 characters for optimal clarity

| Skill | Current | Target | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|--------|
| check-tools | 260+ chars | 120 chars | Condense (see #4) |
| developing-preact | 185 chars | 100-120 chars | Reduce detail |
| preact-developer | 165 chars | N/A | Delete skill (#2) |

**General Pattern:**
- Focus on WHAT (functionality) and WHEN (triggers)
- Remove redundant phrases
- Avoid implementation details in description

---

#### 8. Progressive Disclosure Optimization

**Skills Near Limit:**
- creating-skill (511 lines) - Critical, see #1
- check-tools (473 lines) - High priority, see #4
- developing-preact (453 lines) - Medium priority, see #6

**Recommendation:** Review these for content that could move to references/

---
